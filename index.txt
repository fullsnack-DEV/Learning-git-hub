git stash ==>  Putting the code somewhere else without commitin
git branch ==> create a new branch .if we are workig on a new code and we don't want to add it to the main branch then
 we can make the seprte branch and add new code to that branch
So that our user base will not get affected 
command git branch creates a new branch
what is upstrem URL : =>  the url from where you have forked the project 
if the branch alredy have the pull request and you make the changes to that branch then you can't
create a new pull request that changes will get add to the that pull requests commit it self. 
one branch can be associated with only one pull request. So for every new pull request make the new branch
git fetch ==>  Fetching the data from upstream branch command: =>  git fetch --all --prune , (--prune) to fetch deleted
files as well.
